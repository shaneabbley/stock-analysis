# stock-analysis
### Background
We were attempting to help out friend Steve with his management of his parents investments. They were particularly interested in green energy companies. Tohether we analyzed data about 12 different green energy stocks
### Objective
In our analysis of green energy company securities. We determined the total daily trading volume and the return for two years worth of data. While accomplishing this we intended to learn the basics of VBA and improve upon our programming skills as a whole
### Analysis
In order to accomplish this we used Microsoft's Virtual Basic programming language to manage the the daily prices of the stocks. We originally followed a module to complete this; however, we practced refactoring the code, with an emphasis on improving efficiency.

### Results
I encountered a few difficulties working with VBA. Primarily, the tickerindex variable kept increasing iteratively past the expected 12. I worked around this by hard capping it at 12. This was inefficient and can certainly be improved upon.
### Discussion
Overall the proccess was improved, yet I would utilize a different programming language for this. I have more experience using python and Mathematica for solving problems like this, but VBA is certainly capable of this. This was my first time refactoring code for the purpose of efficiency and readability. I learned a lot about VBA and excel.
